# Playwright Test Automation Framework for Flight Booking

## Overview

This is a test automation framework built with Playwright and TypeScript to automate the testing of a flight booking website. The framework is designed to be robust, maintainable, and easy to use. It follows the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern to separate test logic from UI interaction details.

## Framework Structure

The project follows a standard structure for Playwright test automation frameworks:

```
.
├── pages/
│   └── flight_page.ts
├── tests/
│   └── searchFlights.spec.ts
├── .gitignore
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
├── playwright.config.ts
└── README.md
```

*   **`pages/`**: This directory contains the Page Object Model (POM) classes. Each class represents a page in the application and encapsulates the locators and methods for interacting with that page.
*   **`tests/`**: This directory contains the test scripts. Each test script corresponds to a specific feature or user flow.
*   **`.gitignore`**: This file specifies the files and directories that should be ignored by Git.
*   **`package.json`**: This file defines the project dependencies and scripts.
*   **`package-lock.json`**: This file is automatically generated for `npm` and `yarn` installs and describes the exact tree that was generated, such that subsequent installs are able to generate identical trees, regardless of intermediate dependency updates.
*   **`playwright.config.ts`**: This is the main configuration file for Playwright. It allows you to configure various settings, such as the test runner, browsers, and reporters.
*   **`README.md`**: This file provides an overview of the project and instructions on how to set it up and run the tests.

## Design Choices

The framework is designed with the following principles in mind:

*   **Page Object Model (POM):** The use of the POM pattern makes the tests more readable, maintainable, and reusable. It separates the test logic from the UI interaction details, which makes it easier to update the tests when the UI changes.
*   **Playwright Test Runner:** Playwright is a modern and powerful test automation framework that provides a number of features that make it well-suited for testing web applications. These features include:
    *   **Cross-browser testing:** Playwright supports all modern rendering engines including Chromium, WebKit, and Firefox.
    *   **Parallel execution:** Playwright can run tests in parallel, which can significantly reduce the time it takes to run the tests.
    *   **Auto-waits:** Playwright automatically waits for elements to be ready before interacting with them, which makes the tests more reliable.
*   **TypeScript:** The use of TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, which helps to catch errors early and improve the quality of the code.

## Prerequisites

Before you can run the tests, you need to make sure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

*   [Node.js](https'://nodejs.org/en/) (v14 or higher)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (v6 or higher) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (v1 or higher)

## Installation

To install the project dependencies, follow these steps:

1.  Clone the repository to your local machine.
2.  Open a terminal window and navigate to the project directory.
3.  Run the following command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Tests

To run the tests, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test
```

This will run all of the tests in the `tests/` directory.

To run the tests in headed mode, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test --headed
```

To run the tests in a specific browser, you can use the following command:

```bash
npx playwright test --browser chromium
```

## CI/CD Integration

The framework can be easily integrated into a CI/CD pipeline, such as Jenkins or GitHub Actions.

### Jenkins

To integrate the framework with Jenkins, you can use the following steps:

1.  Install the Node.js plugin in Jenkins.
2.  Create a new Jenkins job and configure it to use the Node.js installation.
3.  In the build step, add a shell command to run the tests:

```bash
npm install
npx playwright test
```

4.  Configure the job to publish the test results.

### GitHub Actions

To integrate the framework with GitHub Actions, you can use the following steps:

1.  Create a new workflow file in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
2.  In the workflow file, define a job to run the tests:

```yaml
name: Playwright Tests
on:
  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]
jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v2
    - name: Use Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '14.x'
    - name: Install dependencies
      run: npm install
    - name: Run Playwright tests
      run: npx playwright test
    - name: Upload report
      uses: actions/upload-artifact@v2
      if: always()
      with:
        name: playwright-report
        path: playwright-report/
        retention-days: 30
```

This workflow will run the tests on every push and pull request to the `main` branch. It will also upload the test results as an artifact.
